### ¡Please do not push to the *main* branch (well you can't anyway haha, but still dont even think about it). Create your own branch and implement your changes!

**Note, this repository does not include key repositories you will need:** *build/*, *log/*, *install/*, and *include/* </br>
You will need to run *colcon build* on the workspace directory (ros-intro-project) and the package dirctories in the *src/* folder to get these directories and be able to build your code.
Follow the instructions document for integrating your code and changes into the *package.xml* and *CMakeLists.txt*
